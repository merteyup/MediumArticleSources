# Application Life Cycle

Repository related to the medium article about Application Life Cycle. 

## Description

I have explained and tried to show with print statements life cycle of an iOS Application. Used AppDelegate and SceneDelegate together to show both actions happening.

## Getting Started

XCode project. Simply clone the repository. 

## Help

- To see the lifecycle, simply run the project and follow the print statements from debug screen below. 
- After every print statement, project will be paused by breakpoints. 
- You will need to continue the execution from breakpoint.
