# Closure 1

Repository related to the medium article about closures topic. 

## Description

I have tried to explain the lifecycle of closures. With this approach, it should be clear to the reader why we need the `@escaping` attribute in some closures.

## Getting Started

Playground file for XCode. Simply clone the repository. 

## Help

To see the difference in `@escaping` closure, change the service function as shown below.
```
let workerService = ClosureWorkerService()

let workerService = ClosureWorkerService2()
```
